                        We carry a wide assortment of live ammunition for
                        all kinds of firearms. However, due to ever-changing
                        inventory and availability, we ask that you please
                        call ahead to make sure that any items you want are
                        in stock before stopping by.

                    <p>
                        Due to legal restrictions regarding the shipping of
                        Hazardous Materials, we cannot ship powders or
                        primers for delivery. All purchases of powder or
                        primers must be picked up from the store in
                        St. Augustine, FL.

                    Whether you choose an FMJ bullet for its deep,
                    bone-shattering penetration or its ability to protect
                    the integrity of the pelt, you'll find the perfect
                    Full Metal Jacket in our traditional line.

                <p>
                    SECANT OGIVE DESIGN
                    Pioneered by Hornady for use in hunting bullets, this
                    technology broke new ground in ballistic engineering and
                    is now used in bullets for everything from match to
                    varmint shooting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The secant ogive is a geometrically developed design that
                    creates the most ballistically efficent profile, yet
                    retains the optimum bearing surface. The combination of
                    the slender point and increased bearing surface results
                    in lower drag, increased stability, flatter trajectories
                    and amazing accuracy.
